# Combined release notes from GitHub with jq and paginate-json

Matt Holt [asked](https://twitter.com/mholt6/status/1690177417393135616):

> Is there a tool that uses the GitHub API to generate a doc with all release notes from a repo?

Here's how to do that with the GitHub [releases API](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/rest/releases/releases?apiVersion=2022-11-28#list-releases) and [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/):

```bash
curl -s 'https://api.github.com/repos/simonw/llm/releases' | \
  jq -r '.[] | "## " + .name + "\n\n*" + .created_at + "*\n\n" + .body + "\n"'
```

The output from that command (run against my [simonw/llm](https://github.com/simonw/llm) repo) starts like this:
```
## 0.6.1

*2023-07-24T15:53:48Z*

- LLM can now be installed directly from Homebrew core: `brew install llm`. [#124](https://github.com/simonw/llm/issues/124)
- Python API documentation now covers [System prompts](https://llm.datasette.io/en/stable/python-api.html#system-prompts).
- Fixed incorrect example in the [Prompt templates](https://llm.datasette.io/en/stable/templates.html#prompt-templates) documentation. Thanks, Jorge Cabello. [#125](https://github.com/simonw/llm/pull/125)

## 0.6

*2023-07-18T21:36:37Z*

- Models hosted on [Replicate](https://replicate.com/) can now be accessed using the [llm-replicate](https://github.com/simonw/llm-replicate) plugin, including the new Llama 2 model from Meta AI. More details here: [Accessing Llama 2 from the command-line with the llm-replicate plugin](https://simonwillison.net/2023/Jul/18/accessing-llama-2/).

```
## Handling paginated responses

The GitHub API paginates responses at 30 items per page. Each JSON document returned includes an HTTP `link` header indicating the next page, like this:
```
link: <https://api.github.com/repositories/140912432/releases?page=2>; rel="next"
```

I wrote my [paginate-json](https://github.com/simonw/paginate-json) tool to help paginate through exactly this kind of output (the WordPress API uses the same pattern, [as does Datasette](https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/json_api.html#pagination)).

You can install that with `pip` or `pipx`:
```bash
pipx install paginate-json
```
Then run the following command to fetch and combine all pages of release notes for a larger project:
```bash
paginate-json 'https://api.github.com/repos/simonw/sqlite-utils/releases' | \
  jq -r '.[] | "## " + .name + "\n\n*" + .created_at + "*\n\n" + .body + "\n"'
```
Example output from that [is here in this Gist](https://gist.github.com/simonw/f5565b0b67cdd3591e00db67c702f5c5).

## Writing the jq recipe with ChatGPT/GPT-4

I can never remember the `jq` syntax even for simple things like this, so I [prompted GPT-4](https://chat.openai.com/share/df880b38-15e3-4398-80ae-8a95a6752244) with:
```
[{"name": "one", "created_at": "dt one", "body": "markdown here"}, {...}]

Write a jq program that turns that into a combined output:

## one

*dt one*

Markdown here

## two... etc
```
It gave me the following:
```bash
jq -r '.[] | "## " + .name + "\n\n*dt " + .created_at + "*\n\n" + .body + "\n"'
```
That wasn't exactly what I needed, but it was very easy to edit that into the final program.

## Turning that into a bash script

I pasted my `paginate-json` recipe into GPT-4 and said:

> Turn this into a bash script that I can run like this: ./combined-release-notes.sh simonw/sqlite-utils

It gave me the following:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Check if the user has provided a repository as an argument
if [ -z "$1" ]; then
    echo "Usage: $0 <github-username/repository>"
    exit 1
fi

# Set the API URL based on the provided repository
URL="https://api.github.com/repos/$1/releases"

# Fetch the release notes and format them
paginate-json "$URL" | \
  jq -r '.[] | "## " + .name + "\n\n*" + .created_at + "*\n\n" + .body + "\n"'
```
I like how it added usage instructions there!

I added that to `combined-release-notes.sh` and ran this:
```bash
chmod 755 combined-release-notes.sh
```
And now I can run this to get release notes for any repo:
```bash
./combined-release-notes.sh simonw/datasette
```

## Using that with LLM

Now that I have a tool that can output combined release notes on the command-line, I decided to try combining it with my [LLM](https://llm.datasette.io/) CLI tool.
```bash
./combined-release-notes.sh simonw/llm | \
  llm -s 'High level explanation of what this tool does'
```
Here's the output from that:

> LLM is a command-line tool that allows users to interact with language models such as GPT-3 and GPT-4. It provides a convenient interface for generating text completions based on a given prompt. Users can input prompts either directly in the command line or by piping text from other sources.
>
> The tool provides additional features such as saving prompts as templates for reuse, logging all prompts and responses to a SQLite database for later review, and the ability to continue previous conversations with chat models.
>
> LLM also includes a plugin mechanism that enables users to install and use additional language models. These plugins can be created to support models hosted on different platforms or provided by different organizations.
>
> Overall, LLM simplifies the process of interacting with language models through a command-line interface, providing more control and flexibility to users.

This also works for asking questions about the project:

```bash
./combined-release-notes.sh simonw/llm | llm -s 'how do I install it'
```
Which replied (using Markdown syntax that I could paste directly into this document):

> To install LLM, you can choose one of the following methods:
>
> 1. Installation using Homebrew (only for versions 0.6.1 and above):
>    - Open your terminal.
>    - Run the command `brew install llm`.
>
> 2. Manual installation using Python package manager `pip`:
>    - Open your terminal.
>    - Run the command `pip install llm`.
>
> Once the installation is complete, you should be able to run LLM commands from your terminal.
