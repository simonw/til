# A few notes on Rye

[Rye](https://github.com/mitsuhiko/rye) is Armin Ronacher's new experimental Python packaging tool. I decided to take it for a test-run.

## Installing Rye

Rye is built in Rust, and currently needs to be installed using Cargo. I had Cargo from previous dalliances with Rust, so I could install Rye using:

    cargo install --git https://github.com/mitsuhiko/rye rye

This resulted in a 6.4MB binary file in:

    ~/.cargo/bin/rye

I added the following line to my `~/.zshrc` file to make it available on my path:

    export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/.cargo/bin

## Installing Python with Rye

The Rye docs suggested running this:

    rye pin cpython@3.11

As far as I can tell all this did was write `3.11.1` to a `~/.python-version` file. I'm not sure if there are any tools other than Rye which pay attention to this file. (UPDATE: [pyenv uses this file too](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv#understanding-python-version-selection))

Actually fetching versions of Python can be done using `rye toolchain fetch VERSION`, for example:

```
% rye toolchain fetch 3.9
Downloading cpython@3.9.16
success: Downloaded cpython@3.9.16
```
This placed a whole bunch of files in `~/.rye/py/cpython@3.9.16/` - `find . | wc -l` reported 4,085 in that directory.

The one that matters most is:

    ~/.rye/py/cpython@3.9.16/install/bin/python3

Which gives me a 3.9.16 Python interpreter.

This is the feature of Rye I'm most excited about: the Python bundles it installs come from Gregory Szorc's [indygreg/python-build-standalone](https://github.com/indygreg/python-build-standalone) project.

This should mean that they completely ignore the many other weird ways that Python can end up installed on a system. Admittedly, this is a _new_ weird way to install Python - but at least it shouldn't clash with anything else.

Normally though you wouldn't use `rye toolchain fetch` at all. The Rye suggested workflow is to run `rye init` in a new directory to create a `pyproject.toml` file:
```
% cd /tmp
/tmp % mkdir my-project   
/tmp % cd my-project 
my-project % rye init
success: Initialized project in /private/tmp/my-project/.
my-project % ls
README.md	pyproject.toml
my-project % cat pyproject.toml 
[project]
name = "my-project"
version = "0.1.0"
description = "Add a short description here"
authors = [
    { name = "Simon Willison", email = "...@gmail.com" }
]
dependencies = []
readme = "README.md"
requires-python = ">= 3.8"
license = { text = "MIT" }

[build-system]
requires = ["hatchling"]
build-backend = "hatchling.build"

[tool.rye]
managed = true
my-project % cat README.md 
# my-project

Describe your project here.

* License: MIT
```
To add dependencies to that project, use `rye add`:

    rye add httpx

This added the following line to `pyproject.toml`:

    dependencies = ["httpx~=0.24.0"]

Then to actually install the dependencies, run `rye sync`:

```
my-project % rye sync
Initializing new virtualenv in /private/tmp/my-project/.venv
Python version: cpython@3.11.1
Generating production lockfile: /private/tmp/my-project/requirements.lock
Generating dev lockfile: /private/tmp/my-project/requirements-dev.lock
Installing dependencies
...
Successfully built my-project
Installing collected packages: sniffio, idna, h11, certifi, anyio, httpcore, httpx, my-project
Successfully installed anyio-3.6.2 certifi-2022.12.7 h11-0.14.0 httpcore-0.17.0 httpx-0.24.0 idna-3.4 my-project-0.1.0 sniffio-1.3.0
Done!
```
This adds a `requirements.lock` file that looks like this:
```
# generated by rye
# use `rye lock` or `rye sync` to update this lockfile
-e file:.
anyio==3.6.2
certifi==2022.12.7
h11==0.14.0
httpcore==0.17.0
httpx==0.24.0
idna==3.4
sniffio==1.3.0
```
And a `requirements-dev.lock` file with identical contents. Presumably this starts to differ as you install dev requirements (another Rye feature).

Your folder will now have a `.venv` hidden folder in it. Inside that is a Python virtual environment containing your installed dependencies and a file called `rye-venv.json` which just contains:

```json
{
  "python": "cpython@3.11.1"
}
```

## Installing global applications

The `rye add X` command adds a dependency to your current virtual environment / Rye project.

`rye install` does something completely different: it installs new global packages, in a similar fashion to `pipx` in that they get their own isolated environments so their dependencies don't clash with other installed applications.

```
% rye install cowsay

```
You can now run `cowsay` with `~/.rye/shims/cowsay`:
```
% ~/.rye/shims/cowsay hello
  _____
| hello |
  =====
     \
      \
        ^__^
        (oo)\_______
        (__)\       )\/\
            ||----w |
            ||     ||
```
You can add `~/.rye/shims` to your `$PATH` to make these commands available everywhere.

## Failing and then succeeding to install Datasette

I tried to install Datasette using `rye install datasette` and got this error:

```
% ~/.rye/shims/datasette 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/Users/simon/.rye/shims/datasette", line 5, in <module>
    from datasette.cli import cli
  File "/Users/simon/.rye/tools/datasette/lib/python3.11/site-packages/datasette/cli.py", line 17, in <module>
    from .app import (
  File "/Users/simon/.rye/tools/datasette/lib/python3.11/site-packages/datasette/app.py", line 14, in <module>
    import pkg_resources
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'pkg_resources'
```
Rye has strong opinions, including omitting `pip` and `setuptools` entirely from the environments that it creates.

[ **UPDATE**: I released [Datasette 0.64.3](https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/changelog.html#v0-64-3) with a fix for this and now it installs correctly under Rye ]

It turns out Datasette includes code that imports `pkg_resources`, assuming that `setuptools` will be present because it's usually there as a Python environment default!

I added `setuptools` to Datasette's `setup.py` dependencies in an attempt to fix that, in [issue #2065](https://github.com/simonw/datasette/issues/2065).

When I'm using `pip` I often install development copies of my projects by feeding them the URL to a `.zip` generated by GitHub, for example:

```
pip install https://github.com/simonw/datasette/archive/main.zip
```
I tried that with `rye install` and got an error:

```
 % rye install https://github.com/simonw/datasette/archive/main.zip
Error: Expected one of `@`, `(`, `<`, `=`, `>`, `~`, `!`, `;`, found `:`
https://github.com/simonw/datasette/archive/main.zip
     ^
```
Evidently Rye doesn't (yet?) support installing from URLs.

> **UPDATE**: Armin [showed me a way](https://twitter.com/mitsuhiko/status/1651470124015054848) to do this:
>
>     rye install 'datasette @ https://github.com/simonw/datasette/archive/main.zip'
>
> This worked - running `~/.rye/shims/datasette --version` confirmed the installation.

Instead, I downloaded the `main.zip` file and ran Rye install against that directly:

```
% rye install main.zip 
Processing ./main.zip
  Installing build dependencies ... done
  Getting requirements to build wheel ... done
...
Successfully built datasette
...
```
That seemed to work. Oddly it didn't add `datasette` to the `.rye/shims` directory - but I did find a working installation here instead:

    ~/.rye/tools/main-zip/bin/datasette
